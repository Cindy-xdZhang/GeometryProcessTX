# CS272: Geometric Modeling

This is a viewer application, using [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org), [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org), and [OpenMesh](https://www.openmesh.org), and based on the [libigl](https://libigl.github.io) viewer.

All dependencies are included in the `external` directory.

You can build this application with `cmake`. It has been tested under **Windows** and **Linux**.

You can use this viewer as the basis for your program. But remember, **all other code you submit must be your own work**.
